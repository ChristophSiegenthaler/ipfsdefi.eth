# ipfsdefi.eth
This webpage is intended to be a centralized archive of decentralized app frontends for DEFI on Ethereum. The page is hosted on IPFS, an IPNS hash will point to the newest version of this file and the ENS domain name ipfsdefi.eth will point to this version.

The aim is for DEFI users to "travel back in time" to find old versions of frontends.
